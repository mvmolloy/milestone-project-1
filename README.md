## Welcome!  
For my User-Centric Front-End Development Milestone Project I have built a website 

This static wesbite is designed to act as an online portfolio that can be used during and after my time learning and creating with the Code Institute. Right now it's primary purpose is to submit as my User Centric Front-End Development project (Milestone 1) but eventually it will serve as a landing page for potential employers and clients. 

## UX
This website was primarily designed with prospective clients in mind. I envisioned my ideal client to be a small business owner looking for a website tailored to their business needs and ethos. 

The design of my site really needed to show them that I can design clean, responsive websites - it needed to showcase a range of skills without bombarding users. I needed it to be easy to navigate, and to speak to any prospective clients, and this needed to be true whether they viewed my website on a mobile device, tablet or computer. 

As my prospective clients scrolled through my site, I wanted them to get an overview of myself, my ethos and my history. I also wanted them to be able to download my CV if they wanted a more formal representation of this. By using project cards, I wanted to show off some of the projects I have done. For potential clients and employers that are more technical, I wanted them to be able to access the GitHub repositories for these projects. By using client stories, I wanted them to get a sense of the impact these projects had on the individuals and businesses they were designed for. Finally, I wanted users to have a way to contact me so we could chat about any potential projects. In the footer I have external links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook page, as well as another link to download my CV. 

#### User Stories 
- As a small business owner in need of a website, I want to view a website where I can really get a sense of the designer, what they have done for other businesses and what they can do for me. I want a sense that a I will be working with a real person who really cares about the website they will build for me and the impact it will have on my business. 
- As a prospective employer, I just want a way to see my potential employee can develop a good website, view a portfolio of their work, and then download and print their CV, so I can assess their skills and experience and decide on whether to contact them for an interview.

#### Wireframes
Two wireframes guided the end design of this project, the first is for mobile devices, and the second scales up this layout for larger devices. I made both using [MockFlow](https://mockflow.com).

#### Colour Scheme 
I chose the two core colours for my website: #c0c0c0 and #065858, which contrast well and look clean. All colours used are based around these, being either tints or shades and provide consistency that ties together all sections of the website. [color-hex](https://www.color-hex.com/) proved a very useful resource in this respect. 


#### Client
My client is myself. I want my website to showcase of my skills and existing projects to potential employers and clients.

## Testing
#### Devices
- **Chrome Developer Tools** used to test responsivity on devices ranging from the Iphone SE to Desktop. Project cast to 4k Monitor to test on larger devices. This showed bootstrap rows/columns/grids to allow site to be fully responsive. Everything is centred to enable responsiveness, and prevent stretching, even on larger screens. 
- **ScrollSpy** works regardless of the order sections are viewed in. Testing showed I had to go back and offset scrolling by the nav height. This is now fixed. 
- **target_blank** successfully opens all external links in a new tab, meaning 
- **download** makes the CV download straight onto users computer into the default folder for downloads
