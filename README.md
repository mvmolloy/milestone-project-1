## Welcome!

This wesbite is designed to act as an online portfolio that can be used during and after my time learning and creating with the Code Institute. Right now it's primary purpose is to submit as my User Centric Front-End Development project (Milestone 1) but eventually it will serve as a landing page for potential employers and clients. 

## UX

#### Client
My client is myself. I want my website to showcase of my skills and existing projects to potential employers and clients. 
**This project meets my goals because**...

#### Users
Users will be potential clients and employers. For such users, it needs to be easy to navigate to learn about me, to view my portfolio, to contact me. This needs to be true whatever device the user is viewing on. 

**This project gives them what they need because**...

#### Mockup 

#### Wireframes

Two wireframes set out the design for this project. Both were made using [MockFlow](https://mockflow.com)

- [Wireframe for mobile devices](https://github.com/mvmolloy/milestone-project-1/blob/master/assets/wireframes/mobile-wireframe.png)
- [Wireframe for larger devices](https://github.com/mvmolloy/milestone-project-1/blob/master/assets/wireframes/desktop-wireframe.png)

## FEATURES

#### Technologies
- **HTML5** and **CSS3**
- **[Bootstrap v4.4(https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/)**
    - The project uses **Bootstrap** to structure the website, make it fully responsive for mobile, tablet, laptop, desktop and large screen devices.
    - The project also uses BootstrapCDN to provide icons from **[FontAwesome](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/fontawesome/)**
- **Gitpod** used as the IDE to develop the code. Committed and pushed to **GitHub** for Deployment.
- **Googlefonts** used to provide all font styles used throughout the project

#### Existing Features 
- Nav
  - **[scrollspy](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/scrollspy/)** aids the navigation through the side
- Hero
- About
- CV - My CV split into two "timelines": one is a traditional timeline of my employment and education history since starting university in 2013. The other displaying my front-end and back-end technical skills. Also includes a button to download printable PDF of traditional CV, which opens in a new tab. 
- Portfolio - showcasing Code Institute projects to date, including Love Running, Whiskey Drop and Rosie Odenkirk's Portfolio. Highlights 4 existing projects and prompts the user to consider if their project might be next. Gives a call-to-action to the contact form. 
- Contact: Including contact form
- Footer: Links to social sites, including Twitter, Git, Facebook, Linked in and another link to download my CV as a PDF. 

#### Future Features 
- [] Make the contact form work 
- [] Add more projects using all the technical skills listed
- [] Add real projects for real clients

## Testing
#### Devices
- **Chrome Developer Tools** used to test responsivity on devices ranging from the Iphone SE to Desktop. Project cast to 4k Monitor to test on larger devices. This showed bootstrap rows/columns/grids to allow site to be fully responsive. Everything is centred to enable responsiveness, and prevent stretching, even on larger screens. 
- **ScrollSpy** works regardless of the order sections are viewed in. Testing showed I had to go back and offset scrolling by the nav height. This is now fixed. 
- **target_blank** successfully opens all external links in a new tab, meaning 
- **download** makes the CV download straight onto users computer into the default folder for downloads
